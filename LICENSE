# This script uses the openssl executable to connect to a server and test
# each of the SSL cipher methods supported by the local openssl client.
# By default it checks 443, for HTTPs, but will work on any SSL enabled
# port.  The default output is just a listing of each cipher and TLS1,
# SSLv2 and SSLv3 and SUCCESS or FAIL message.  It automatically creates
# a log called ssl_dump.log (over written with each run) that has the 
# specific output of each openssl call.

#  Note:  BEAST  and CRIME are coming.
#   BEAST takes advantage of a flaw in block ciphers
#        The vuln is in TLS1.0 only and only there when using block 
#         ciphers with CBC.  Basically if the server used TLS1.0 and 
#         supports any cipher other than RC4 it is potentially vulnerable.
#   CRIME takes advantage in how SSL compression is handled in TLS1.0
#
# As of October 2014 SSLv3 is considered weak due to POODLE
